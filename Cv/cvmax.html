			<h1>About me</h1>

				<p>I was born on 30 September 1997 in Hasselt, Belgium. my family has a long association with motor sports: my father, Jos Verstappen, is a Dutch former Formula One driver, and my Belgian mother, Sophie Kumpen, competed in karting, and my second cousin, Anthony Kumpen, competed in endurance racing and is a two-time NASCAR Whelen Euro Series champion and currently serves as the team manager for PK Carsport in Euro Series.
					<br><br>
Although i have a Belgian mother, was born in Belgium and resided in Bree, Belgium, i decided to compete with a Dutch racing licence because hi feels more Dutch, i spent more time with my father than with my mother owing to his karting activities, and was always surrounded by Dutch people while growing up in Maaseik, a Belgian town at the Dutch border. I competed in Formula One for more than half a season before obtaining a road driver's licence on his 18th birthday. I have lived in Monaco since October 2015, it was not for tax reasons. I do sim racing as a hobby. I won the Team Redline "2020 Real Racers Never Quit" championship that ran in the beginning of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The series ran over multiple rounds on the racing simulator iRacing. I will team up with fellow current Formula One driver Lando Norris on 13-14 June 2020 as drivers for Team Redline at a virtual version of the 24 Hours of Le Mans to  be run on rFactor 2. In the race both Norris and me will compete against fellow current and former Formula One drivers with the likes of Pierre Gasly, Juan Pablo Montoya, Charles Leclerc, Antonio Giovinazzi, Rubens Barrichello, Jan Magnussen, Jean-Ã‰ric Vergne, Stoffel Vandoorne and Jenson Button all scheduled to compete in the event.</p>
